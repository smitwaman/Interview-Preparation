let's walk through an example of using the Recreate deployment strategy in Kubernetes.

**Recreate Deployment Strategy:**

In the Recreate deployment strategy, the existing pods are terminated before new pods are created with the updated version. This approach results in downtime during the deployment process but is straightforward to implement.

**Example:**

Let's assume we have a Deployment named `myapp` with version 1.0 already running in our Kubernetes cluster, and we want to upgrade it to version 2.0 using the Recreate strategy.

1. **Deployment Setup:**

   First, let's create a Deployment for version 1.0 of our application:
   ```yaml
   # myapp-deployment.yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: myapp
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: myapp
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: myapp
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: myapp
           image: myapp:1.0
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```

   Apply the Deployment manifest to create the initial version 1.0 of the application:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f myapp-deployment.yaml
   ```

2. **Upgrade to Version 2.0:**

   Now, let's update the Deployment to version 2.0 of our application by changing the image:
   ```yaml
   # myapp-deployment.yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: myapp
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: myapp
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: myapp
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: myapp
           image: myapp:2.0
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```

   Apply the updated Deployment manifest:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f myapp-deployment.yaml --record
   ```

3. **Monitor Deployment Progress:**

   Since we are using the Recreate strategy, Kubernetes will terminate all pods with the old version and create new pods with the updated version. You can monitor the deployment progress using:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout status deployment myapp
   ```

   This command will indicate when the new pods are available.

4. **Verify Deployment:**

   Once the rollout is complete, verify that the pods are running the new version:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -l app=myapp
   ```

In this example, we upgraded our application from version 1.0 to version 2.0 using the Recreate deployment strategy. The existing pods were terminated before new pods with the updated version were created, resulting in downtime during the deployment process.
