Promotion or rollback in the context of A/B Testing Deployment refers to the actions taken based on the analysis of the performance and user experience of different versions of the application. These actions involve either promoting the experimental version (version B) to a full rollout or rolling back to the stable version (version A) in case of issues or unsatisfactory results.

Here's how to perform promotion or rollback in Kubernetes:

1. **Promotion to Full Rollout:**
   
   If version B performs better than version A and meets the desired criteria, you can promote it to a full rollout by directing all traffic to version B.

   Example:
   Update the Service configuration to route all traffic to version B:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: myapp-ingress
   spec:
     rules:
     - http:
         paths:
         - path: /
           pathType: Prefix
           backend:
             service:
               name: myapp-b
               port:
                 number: 80
       weight: 100  # Route all traffic to version B
   ```
   Apply the updated Service configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f myapp-service.yaml
   ```

2. **Rollback to Stable Version:**

   If version B does not meet expectations, introduces issues, or performs worse than version A, you can roll back to the stable version by directing traffic back to version A.

   Example:
   Revert the Service configuration to route all traffic to version A:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: myapp-ingress
   spec:
     rules:
     - http:
         paths:
         - path: /
           pathType: Prefix
           backend:
             service:
               name: myapp-a
               port:
                 number: 80
       weight: 100  # Route all traffic to version A
   ```
   Apply the updated Service configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f myapp-service.yaml
   ```

By performing promotion or rollback based on the observed results of the A/B Testing Deployment, you can make informed decisions about feature releases or changes, ensuring the best possible user experience for your application.
