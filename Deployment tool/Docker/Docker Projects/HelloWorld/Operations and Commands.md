Sure, here's a step-by-step guide to building an image from a Dockerfile, pushing it to Docker Hub registry, pulling it from the registry, and running it in a container with a simple Hello World application:

1. **Create HelloWorld.html**:
2. **Create Dockerfile**:

3. **Build Image**:

   Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile:
   ```bash
   docker build -t hello-world-app .
   ```

4. **Tag the Image**:

   Tag the image with your Docker Hub username and repository name:
   ```bash
   docker tag hello-world-app <username>/hello-world-app:latest
   ```
   Replace `<username>` with your Docker Hub username.

5. **Log in to Docker Hub**:

   Log in to Docker Hub using the `docker login` command:
   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

6. **Push Image to Docker Hub**:

   Push the tagged image to Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker push <username>/hello-world-app:latest
   ```
   Replace `<username>` with your Docker Hub username.

7. **Pull Image from Docker Hub**:

   On another machine or environment where you want to deploy the container, pull the image from Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker pull <username>/hello-world-app:latest
   ```
   Replace `<username>` with your Docker Hub username.

8. **Run Container from Pulled Image**:

   Finally, run a container from the pulled image:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name hello-world-container -p 8080:80 <username>/hello-world-app:latest
   ```
   This command will run a container named `hello-world-container` in detached mode, exposing port 8080 on the host and forwarding traffic to port 80 in the container.

9. **Access the Hello World Application**:

   Access the Hello World application by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser. You should see the "Hello, World!" message displayed.
