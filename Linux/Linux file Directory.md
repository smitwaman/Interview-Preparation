## Linux Directories
Here are some common Linux directories and their typical uses:

1. **/ (Root Directory)**:
   - The root directory is the top-level directory in the Linux filesystem hierarchy.
   - It contains all other directories and files in the system.
   - This directory typically includes system files, configuration files, and essential binaries.

2. **/bin (Binaries)**:
   - This directory contains essential command binaries (executable programs) used by the system and users.
   - Common utilities such as `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `mkdir`, and `rm` are stored here.

3. **/boot (Boot Files)**:
   - The `/boot` directory contains files needed for the boot process, including the Linux kernel, bootloader configuration files (e.g., GRUB), and boot loader images.

4. **/etc (Configuration Files)**:
   - This directory contains system-wide configuration files used by various applications and services.
   - Configuration files for system services (e.g., networking, DNS, Apache) and system settings (e.g., user accounts, environment variables) are stored here.

5. **/home (Home Directories)**:
   - Each user on the system typically has a subdirectory within `/home`, which serves as their home directory.
   - User-specific files, such as personal documents, settings, and preferences, are stored here.

6. **/lib (Libraries)**:
   - The `/lib` directory contains shared libraries (dynamic link libraries) essential for system functionality and running programs.
   - These libraries provide functions and resources used by executable files at runtime.

7. **/opt (Optional Packages)**:
   - The `/opt` directory is used for installing optional or add-on software packages.
   - Third-party software or locally compiled applications can be installed here to keep them separate from system-provided binaries.

8. **/sbin (System Binaries)**:
   - Similar to `/bin`, the `/sbin` directory contains essential command binaries.
   - However, the binaries in `/sbin` are typically intended for system administration tasks and are not intended for regular user access.

9. **/tmp (Temporary Files)**:
   - The `/tmp` directory is used for storing temporary files created by system and user processes.
   - Temporary files are usually deleted upon system reboot or periodically to free up disk space.

10. **/usr (User Binaries)**:
    - The `/usr` directory contains user binaries, libraries, documentation, and other non-essential system files.
    - It includes subdirectories such as `/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/include`, and `/usr/share`, which store user-installed software and data.

11. **/var (Variable Data)**:
    - The `/var` directory contains variable data files that may change frequently during system operation.
    - Logs, spool files (e.g., printer queues), mailboxes, and other transient data are stored here.
