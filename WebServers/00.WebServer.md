list of web servers commonly used for serving both frontend and backend components of web applications:

1. **Apache HTTP Server**:
   - Apache HTTP Server, often referred to as Apache, is one of the most widely used open-source web servers. It supports various programming languages and technologies for both frontend and backend development. Apache can serve static files and dynamically generated content using modules like mod_php, mod_python, and mod_perl.

2. **Nginx**:
   - Nginx is a high-performance, open-source web server known for its speed, scalability, and efficiency. It is commonly used as a reverse proxy and load balancer in front of backend servers. Nginx can serve static files efficiently and also act as a proxy to backend application servers like Node.js, Python, Ruby on Rails, and others.

3. **Node.js**:
   - Node.js is not just a web server but also a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side. With the help of frameworks like Express.js, Koa.js, and Hapi.js, Node.js can be used to build both frontend and backend components of web applications. It is particularly popular for building real-time applications and APIs.

4. **Apache Tomcat**:
   - Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container designed for running Java web applications. It supports Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and other Java technologies for building dynamic web applications. Tomcat is commonly used in conjunction with frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

5. **Jetty**:
   - Jetty is a lightweight and embeddable web server and servlet container written in Java. It is highly scalable and can be embedded into Java applications for serving web content. Jetty is commonly used for deploying Java web applications and web services.

6. **Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)**:
   - Internet Information Services (IIS) is a web server developed by Microsoft for Windows servers. It supports various technologies and frameworks for building both frontend and backend components of web applications, including ASP.NET, PHP, Node.js, and others.

7. **Python built-in HTTP server**:
   - Python comes with a built-in HTTP server module that allows you to serve files and run simple web applications directly from the command line. While it's not suitable for production use, it's useful for local development and testing of Python-based web applications.

8. **Django development server**:
   - Django is a high-level web framework for Python that comes with a built-in development server for running Django applications locally. While it's not recommended for production use, it's convenient for developing and testing Django applications before deployment to production servers.

9. **Flask development server**:
   - Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that comes with a built-in development server for running Flask applications locally. Similar to the Django development server, it's useful for local development and testing of Flask applications.

These are some of the web servers commonly used for serving both frontend and backend components of web applications. Depending on your project requirements, infrastructure, and technology stack, you may choose one of these servers or a combination of them for hosting your web applications
