scenario-based interview questions focused on Amazon EC2:

1. **Scenario 1: Instance Selection**:
   You're tasked with deploying a database server for a high-traffic e-commerce website. What EC2 instance type would you choose, and why?
============================================
2. **Scenario 2: High Availability**:
   Your company requires a highly available web application. How would you architect the EC2 instances to ensure redundancy and fault tolerance?
============================================
3. **Scenario 3: Cost Optimization**:
   Your organization wants to optimize costs for its EC2 instances. How would you recommend minimizing costs while maintaining performance?
============================================
4. **Scenario 4: Disaster Recovery**:
   Your company needs a disaster recovery plan for its EC2 instances. Describe how you would implement a solution to minimize downtime in case of a region-wide outage.
============================================
5. **Scenario 5: Security Configuration**:
   You've been tasked with securing EC2 instances hosting sensitive data. What security measures would you implement to protect against unauthorized access?
============================================
6. **Scenario 6: Auto Scaling**:
   Your application experiences varying traffic throughout the day. How would you configure Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand?
============================================
7. **Scenario 7: Application Deployment**:
   You need to deploy a containerized application on EC2 instances. How would you set up the infrastructure to support container deployment and orchestration?
============================================
8. **Scenario 8: Cross-Region Replication**:
   Your organization requires data redundancy across multiple regions. How would you configure EC2 instances to replicate data between regions?
============================================
9. **Scenario 9: Hybrid Cloud Integration**:
