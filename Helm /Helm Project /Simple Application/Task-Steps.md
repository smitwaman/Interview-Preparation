let's create a Helm chart project for deploying a simple "Hello, World!" application. We'll include all the necessary YAML files for the deployment along with the Helm commands to build and deploy the chart.

1. **Create a New Helm Chart**:
   ```bash
   helm create hello-world
   ```

2. **Edit Chart Metadata (Chart.yaml)**:
   Update the `Chart.yaml` file with the appropriate metadata for your chart.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v2
   name: hello-world
   version: 1.0.0
   ```

3. **Edit Default Configuration Values (values.yaml)**:
   Update the `values.yaml` file with the default configuration values for your application.
   ```yaml
   replicaCount: 1
   image:
     repository: nginx
     tag: latest
     pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
   service:
     type: ClusterIP
     port: 80
   ```

4. **Create Deployment YAML (templates/deployment.yaml)**:
   This file defines the Deployment for the "Hello, World!" application.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: {{ include "hello-world.fullname" . }}
     labels:
       app: {{ include "hello-world.name" . }}
       chart: {{ include "hello-world.chart" . }}
   spec:
     replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: {{ include "hello-world.name" . }}
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: {{ include "hello-world.name" . }}
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
             image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag }}"
             imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.image.pullPolicy }}
             ports:
               - containerPort: 80
   ```

5. **Create Service YAML (templates/service.yaml)**:
   This file defines the Service for the "Hello, World!" application.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: {{ include "hello-world.fullname" . }}
     labels:
       app: {{ include "hello-world.name" . }}
       chart: {{ include "hello-world.chart" . }}
   spec:
     type: {{ .Values.service.type }}
     ports:
       - port: {{ .Values.service.port }}
         targetPort: 80
     selector:
       app: {{ include "hello-world.name" . }}
   ```

6. **Optional: Create Ingress YAML (templates/ingress.yaml)**:
   This file defines the Ingress for the "Hello, World!" application (if needed).
   ```yaml
   {{- if .Values.ingress.enabled }}
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: {{ include "hello-world.fullname" . }}
     annotations:
       {{- toYaml .Values.ingress.annotations | nindent 4 }}
   spec:
     rules:
       {{- range .Values.ingress.hosts }}
       - host: {{ .host }}
         http:
           paths:
             {{- range .paths }}
             - path: {{ . }}
               pathType: Prefix
               backend:
                 service:
                   name: {{ include "hello-world.fullname" . }}
                   port:
                     number: 80
             {{- end }}
       {{- end }}
   {{- end }}
   ```

7. **Build and Deploy the Helm Chart**:
   Use the following commands to build and deploy the Helm chart:
   ```bash
   helm install my-hello-world ./hello-world
   ```

8. **Verify Deployment**:
   Check the status of the deployed resources using `kubectl` commands:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl get services
   ```

9. **Optional: Enable Ingress (if needed)**:
   If you included an Ingress resource and want to expose your application externally, enable it:
   ```bash
   helm upgrade my-hello-world ./hello-world --set ingress.enabled=true
   ```

10. **Optional: Rollback Deployment (if needed)**:
    If you encounter issues after deployment, rollback to a previous stable version:
    ```bash
    helm rollback my-hello-world <REVISION_NUMBER>
    ```

11. **Optional: Delete the Helm Release (if needed)**:
    If you want to delete the Helm release and associated Kubernetes resources:
    ```bash
    helm delete my-hello-world
    ```

These commands and YAML files allow you to create, deploy, and manage the Helm chart for your "Hello, World!" application. Adjust the values in the `values.yaml` file as needed for your deployment requirements. Make sure to replace `<REVISION_NUMBER>` with the appropriate revision number if you need to rollback the deployment. Additionally, adjust the Helm release name (`my-hello-world`) and chart directory (`./hello-world`) according to your preferences
