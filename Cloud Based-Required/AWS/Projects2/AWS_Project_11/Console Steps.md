## Detailed Steps

### 1. Create Step Functions state machine

1. **Navigate to Step Functions**
    - Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Step Functions service.

2. **Create a new state machine**
    - Click on "Create a state machine".
  
3. **Define the state machine**
    - Enter a name for the state machine.
    - Choose the "Standard" workflow type.
    - Select "Create an IAM role" to allow Step Functions to execute Lambda functions on your behalf.
    - Click on "Create state machine".

### 2. Define workflow steps

1. **Add a new state**
    - Click on "Add state" to add a new state to your state machine.
  
2. **Configure the state**
    - Enter a name for the state.
    - Select "Lambda function" as the state type.
    - Choose the Lambda function you want to invoke from the dropdown list.
    - Click on "Add".

3. **Define state transitions**
    - Drag the arrow from the start state to the Lambda state to define the initial transition.
    - You can add more states and transitions as needed by repeating steps 1 and 2.

4. **Save and test the state machine**
    - Click on "Save" to save the state machine.
    - Click on "Start execution" to test the state machine by providing input if required.
