Data Encryption project using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) through the AWS Management Console.

### Tools and Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**
  - Make sure you have an AWS account. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).

- **AWS Management Console Access**
  - Open your web browser and navigate to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).

- **AWS CLI**
  - Install AWS CLI on your local machine.
  - Configure AWS CLI with your AWS credentials using `aws configure`.

### Required Services

- **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**

---

## Building Steps

### Step 1: Create KMS Key

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
   - Sign in using your AWS account credentials.

2. **Navigate to AWS KMS**
   - In the AWS Management Console, search for "KMS" in the services search bar or find it under the "Security, Identity, & Compliance" section.

3. **Create a New KMS Key**
   - In the KMS dashboard, click on "Create a key".
   - Choose "Symmetric" as the key type.
   - Enter a description for the key, for example, "MyEncryptionKey".
   - Configure other settings as needed, such as key administrators, key usage permissions, and key rotation.
   - Click on "Next" and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the key creation.

### Step 2: Encrypt/Decrypt Data

1. **Encrypt Data**
   - In the KMS dashboard, select the key you created under "Customer managed keys".
   - Click on "Encrypt" to encrypt data using the KMS key.
   - Enter or upload the plaintext data that you want to encrypt.
   - Review the encryption context (optional) and click on "Encrypt".
   - Copy the encrypted data and store it securely.

2. **Decrypt Data**
   - To decrypt the encrypted data, click on "Decrypt" in the KMS dashboard.
   - Paste the encrypted data that you want to decrypt.
   - Review the encryption context (optional) and click on "Decrypt".
   - The decrypted plaintext data will be displayed.

### Note

- AWS KMS provides built-in integration with other AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, Amazon RDS, etc., to encrypt/decrypt data at rest.
- Ensure to configure the IAM roles and permissions for KMS to access other AWS services and perform encryption/decryption operations as needed.
- Monitor the KMS keys, encryption operations, and usage metrics in the KMS dashboard to track key usage, audit encryption activities, and manage key rotations.

That's it! You've successfully set up a Data Encryption project using AWS KMS, created a KMS key for encrypting/decrypting data, and performed encryption/decryption operations. Remember to securely manage and protect your KMS keys, monitor encryption activities, and ensure compliance with data security and privacy regulations to protect your sensitive data at rest and in transit.
