Terraform configuration to set up an S3 bucket and upload files to it:

### Prerequisites
- Install Terraform
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials

### Terraform Configuration Files

#### `main.tf`
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1" # Choose your desired AWS region
}

# Create S3 bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name" # Replace with your unique bucket name
  acl    = "private" # Set ACL to private, or adjust as needed

  tags = {
    Name        = "MyS3Bucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}

# Upload files to S3 bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "my_files" {
  for_each = fileset("${path.module}/files_to_upload/", "*.*") # Path to your files

  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.bucket
  key    = each.value
  source = "${path.module}/files_to_upload/${each.value}" # Path to your files
  acl    = "public-read" # Set ACL to public-read, or adjust as needed
}
```

#### `variables.tf`
```hcl
variable "region" {
  description = "AWS region"
  default     = "us-east-1"
}
```

### Steps to Execute Terraform Configuration

1. **Prepare Files**: Place the files you want to upload in a directory named `files_to_upload` within the directory where your Terraform configuration resides.

2. **Initialize Terraform**
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

3. **Validate and Plan**
    ```bash
    terraform validate
    terraform plan
    ```

4. **Apply Configuration**
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

After executing these commands, Terraform will create:
- An S3 bucket named `my-unique-bucket-name` (adjust as needed).
- Upload the files from the `files_to_upload` directory to the S3 bucket.

Remember to replace placeholders like `my-unique-bucket-name` and adjust configurations as per your specific requirements
