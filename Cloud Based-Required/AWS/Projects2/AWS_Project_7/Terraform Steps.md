Terraform configuration to set up a Content Delivery Network using Amazon CloudFront with an S3 bucket as the origin, in the given sequence:

### Prerequisites
- Install Terraform
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials

### Terraform Configuration Files

#### `main.tf`
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1" # Choose your desired AWS region
}

# Create S3 bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name" # Replace with your unique bucket name
  acl    = "private"
}

# Create CloudFront distribution
resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "my_distribution" {
  origin {
    domain_name = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.bucket_regional_domain_name
    origin_id   = "S3Origin"
    
    s3_origin_config {
      origin_access_identity = ""
    }
  }

  enabled             = true
  is_ipv6_enabled     = true
  comment             = "My CloudFront Distribution"
  
  default_cache_behavior {
    allowed_methods  = ["GET", "HEAD"]
    cached_methods   = ["GET", "HEAD"]
    target_origin_id = "S3Origin"
    
    forwarded_values {
      query_string = false
      cookies {
        forward = "none"
      }
    }
    
    viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"
    min_ttl                = 0
    default_ttl            = 3600
    max_ttl                = 86400
  }

  # Additional distribution configurations
  # Add SSL Certificate, Custom Domain, etc. as needed
  
  restrictions {
    geo_restriction {
      restriction_type = "none"
    }
  }
}
```

### Steps to Execute Terraform Configuration

#### Step 1: Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

#### Step 2: Validate Configuration
```bash
terraform validate
```

#### Step 3: Plan Configuration
```bash
terraform plan
```

#### Step 4: Apply Configuration
```bash
terraform apply
```

After executing these commands in the given sequence, Terraform will:

1. Create an S3 bucket named `my-unique-bucket-name` (adjust as needed).
2. Create a CloudFront distribution with the S3 bucket as the origin.

Remember to replace placeholders like `my-unique-bucket-name` and adjust configurations as per your specific requirements. You can also add additional configurations such as SSL certificate, custom domain, etc., in the `aws_cloudfront_distribution` resource block as needed
