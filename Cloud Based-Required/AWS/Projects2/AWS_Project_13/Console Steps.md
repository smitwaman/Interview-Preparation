- Amazon SageMaker
- Amazon S3

---

### Building Steps

#### Step 1: Create SageMaker Notebook Instance
1. **Log in** to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to **Services** and select **Amazon SageMaker**.
3. In the SageMaker dashboard, click **Notebook instances**.
4. Click **Create notebook instance**.
5. **Notebook instance name**:
   - Enter a name for your notebook instance (e.g., `MyNotebookInstance`).
6. **Notebook instance type**:
   - Choose an instance type (e.g., `ml.t2.medium`).
7. **IAM role**:
   - Create a new IAM role or use an existing one with SageMaker permissions.
8. Click **Create notebook instance**.

#### Step 2: Develop and Train Model
1. **Notebook Dashboard**:
   - Once the notebook instance is **InService**, click **Open Jupyter**.
2. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Create a new notebook or use the provided one.
   - Develop your machine learning model code (e.g., using Python and libraries like TensorFlow, Scikit-learn).
   - Load your ML data from Amazon S3 or any other source.
   - Train your model using SageMaker's built-in algorithms or custom code.
3. **Save and Close**:
   - Save your notebook and close the Jupyter interface when done.

#### Step 3: Store ML Data in S3
1. **Amazon S3 Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to **Services** and select **S3**.
2. **Create Bucket**:
   - Click **Create bucket**.
   - **Bucket name**:
     - Enter a unique name for your bucket (e.g., `my-ml-data-bucket`).
   - Click **Create**.
3. **Upload ML Data**:
   - Open the bucket and click **Upload**.
   - Choose the ML data files or folders to upload.
   - Click **Upload**.
