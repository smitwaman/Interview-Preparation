Steps to learn Java language would involve several key components:

1. **Introduction to Java**: the basics of Java syntax, data types, variables, and operators.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: the principles of OOP including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

3. **Control Flow**: control flow statements such as if-else, switch-case, loops (for, while, do-while).

4. **Exception Handling**: find exception handling mechanisms in Java including try-catch blocks, throwing exceptions, and handling checked and unchecked exceptions.

5. **Collections Framework**: Cover up the Java Collections Framework including Lists, Sets, Maps, and their implementations (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, TreeMap, etc.).

6. **Generics**: learn generics in Java and how they are used to create parameterized types.

7. **File Handling**: learn for reading from and writing to files in Java using FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, etc.

8. **Concurrency**: learn the basics of concurrency in Java including threads, synchronization, and thread safety.

9. **GUI Programming**: get an overview of GUI programming in Java using Swing or JavaFX, including event handling.

10. **Database Connectivity (JDBC)**: JDBC for connecting Java applications to databases, executing SQL queries, and handling result sets.

11. **Introduction to Frameworks**: learn popular Java frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and JUnit for dependency injection, ORM, and unit testing respectively.

12. **Project Work**: projects to apply the concepts learned throughout the course, such as building a simple application, a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with database connectivity, etc.

13. **Best Practices and Design Patterns**: best practices in Java programming such as coding conventions, naming conventions, and commonly used design patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.

14. **Testing and Debugging**: Cover techniques for testing Java code and debugging using IDEs like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

15. **Advanced Topics (Optional)**: you can include advanced topics such as networking, servlets, JSP, JavaFX, microservices, etc.
