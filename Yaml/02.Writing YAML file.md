**Writing YAML Documents:**

**Creating YAML Files:**
- YAML files are text files with the `.yaml` or `.yml` extension.
- You can create YAML files using any text editor, such as Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Vim.
- When creating YAML documents, you structure the data using YAML syntax, which includes scalars, sequences, mappings, and indentation.

**Indentation and Whitespace:**
- Indentation and whitespace are significant in YAML to denote the structure and hierarchy of data.
- Indentation is used to indicate nested structures, such as sequences within sequences or mappings within mappings.
- YAML typically uses spaces for indentation, although tabs can also be used. However, it's essential to be consistent and not mix spaces and tabs.
- The recommended indentation style is two spaces per level.
- Here's an example demonstrating indentation and whitespace in a YAML document:
```yaml
person:
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
  hobbies:
    - Reading
    - Cooking
  address:
    city: New York
    country: USA
```

**Comments:**
- Comments in YAML start with the `#` symbol and are used for documentation, annotation, or explanation purposes.
- Comments can appear on their own lines or at the end of a line of YAML code.
- Comments are ignored by YAML parsers and do not affect the structure or content of the data.
- Here's an example of comments in a YAML document:
```yaml
# This is a YAML document representing a person
person:
  # Name of the person
  name: John Doe
  
  # Age of the person
  age: 30
  
  # List of hobbies
  hobbies:
    - Reading
    - Cooking
  
  # Address of the person
  address:
    # City where the person lives
    city: New York
    
    # Country where the person lives
    country: USA
```

When writing YAML documents, pay attention to indentation, whitespace, and comments to ensure readability and maintainability. Proper formatting makes it easier for humans to understand the structure of the data and for parsers to interpret it correctly.
