Control flow statements are used in programming to determine the order in which statements are executed. Here are explanations with examples for each type:

1. **if-else statements**:
   ```python
   # Example: Checking if a number is positive, negative, or zero
   num = 10
   if num > 0:
       print("Positive")
   elif num < 0:
       print("Negative")
   else:
       print("Zero")
   ```

2. **switch-case statements**:
   Not all programming languages have a built-in switch-case statement, but you can achieve similar functionality using if-elif-else constructs. Here's an example in Python:
   ```python
   # Example: Checking the day of the week using switch-case
   day = 3
   if day == 1:
       print("Monday")
   elif day == 2:
       print("Tuesday")
   elif day == 3:
       print("Wednesday")
   elif day == 4:
       print("Thursday")
   elif day == 5:
       print("Friday")
   else:
       print("Weekend")
   ```

3. **for loop**:
   ```python
   # Example: Printing numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop
   for i in range(1, 6):
       print(i)
   ```

4. **while loop**:
   ```python
   # Example: Printing numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop
   i = 1
   while i <= 5:
       print(i)
       i += 1
   ```

5. **do-while loop**:
   Python doesn't have a built-in do-while loop, but you can achieve similar functionality using a while loop with a condition that always evaluates to true and then breaking out of the loop when necessary:
   ```python
   # Example: Simulating a do-while loop to ask for user input until a valid number is entered
   while True:
       num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
       if num >= 0:
           break
   print("You entered a positive number:", num)
   ```

These examples illustrate how control flow statements are used to make decisions and repeat actions in a program.
