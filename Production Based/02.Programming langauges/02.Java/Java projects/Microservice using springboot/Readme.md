Creating an entire online shopping site with microservices architecture involves multiple microservices, each responsible for specific functionalities such as user management, product catalog, cart management, order processing, etc. Due to space limitations, I'll provide a simplified version of the project structure along with the essential files for some of the microservices:

1. **User Service**:
   - **UserController.java**: Handles user-related API endpoints.
   - **UserService.java**: Implements user-related business logic.
   - **User.java**: Defines the User model.
   - **pom.xml**: Maven configuration for the user service.

2. **Product Service**:
   - **ProductController.java**: Handles product-related API endpoints.
   - **ProductService.java**: Implements product-related business logic.
   - **Product.java**: Defines the Product model.
   - **pom.xml**: Maven configuration for the product service.

3. **Cart Service**:
   - **CartController.java**: Handles cart-related API endpoints.
   - **CartService.java**: Implements cart-related business logic.
   - **CartItem.java**: Defines the CartItem model.
   - **Cart.java**: Defines the Cart model.
   - **pom.xml**: Maven configuration for the cart service.

4. **Order Service**:
   - **OrderController.java**: Handles order-related API endpoints.
   - **OrderService.java**: Implements order-related business logic.
   - **OrderItem.java**: Defines the OrderItem model.
   - **Order.java**: Defines the Order model.
   - **pom.xml**: Maven configuration for the order service.

5. **Authentication Service**:
   - **AuthController.java**: Handles authentication-related API endpoints (e.g., login, logout).
   - **AuthService.java**: Implements authentication-related business logic.
   - **UserDetails.java**: Defines the UserDetails model for authentication.
   - **pom.xml**: Maven configuration for the authentication service.

6. **Discovery Service** (Eureka or Consul):
   - **DiscoveryServerApplication.java**: Main class to run the discovery server.
   - **pom.xml**: Maven configuration for the discovery service.

7. **API Gateway** (Spring Cloud Gateway or Netflix Zuul):
   - **GatewayApplication.java**: Main class to run the API gateway.
   - **GatewayConfig.java**: Configuration class for the API gateway.
   - **pom.xml**: Maven configuration for the API gateway.

8. **Configuration Service** (Spring Cloud Config Server):
   - **ConfigServerApplication.java**: Main class to run the configuration server.
   - **application.properties**: Configuration properties for the configuration server.
   - **pom.xml**: Maven configuration for the configuration service.

These are just the essential files for each microservice in a simplified online shopping site with microservices architecture. Depending on the requirements and complexity of your application, you may have additional files such as DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), repositories, service interfaces, exception handlers, etc. Additionally, you would configure database connections, logging, security, and other aspects as per your application needs.
