Certainly! Let's explore multiple examples across different domains to understand the variety of application architectures.

### 1. Monolithic Architecture

#### Example 1: Online Bookstore

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Java with Spring Boot
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

#### Example 2: Inventory Management System

- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: .NET Framework
- **Database**: MySQL

### 2. Microservices Architecture

#### Example 1: Streaming Service (like Netflix)

- **User Service**: Manages user profiles
- **Content Service**: Stores movies and shows
- **Billing Service**: Handles subscription payments

#### Example 2: Travel Booking Platform

- **Flight Service**: Manages flight bookings
- **Hotel Service**: Handles hotel reservations
- **Payment Service**: Processes payments

### 3. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

#### Example 1: Healthcare System

- **Patient Service**: Manages patient records
- **Appointment Service**: Handles appointment scheduling
- **Billing Service**: Processes insurance claims

#### Example 2: Retail Chain Management

- **Inventory Service**: Manages store inventory
- **Order Service**: Processes online orders
- **Customer Service**: Handles customer relations

### 4. Serverless Architecture

#### Example 1: Image Processing Service

- **Function**: `resizeImage`
  - **Event**: New image upload
  - **Action**: Resizes and stores image in cloud storage

#### Example 2: Data Processing Pipeline

- **Function**: `processData`
  - **Event**: New data file
  - **Action**: Processes data and stores results

### 5. Event-Driven Architecture

#### Example 1: Real-Time Dashboard

- **Producer**: Logs data from sensors
- **Event**: New sensor data
- **Consumer**: Updates real-time dashboard

#### Example 2: Notification System

- **Producer**: Generates notifications
- **Event**: New notification
- **Consumer**: Sends notification to user

### 6. Layered Architecture

#### Example 1: Banking Application

- **Presentation Layer**: Web interface (HTML, CSS)
- **Business Layer**: Java with Spring Framework
- **Data Layer**: Oracle Database

#### Example 2: E-Learning Platform

- **Presentation Layer**: Mobile App (React Native)
- **Business Layer**: Python with Django
- **Data Layer**: MongoDB

### Summary:

- **Monolithic**: Online Bookstore, Inventory Management
- **Microservices**: Streaming Service, Travel Booking
- **SOA**: Healthcare System, Retail Chain Management
- **Serverless**: Image Processing, Data Pipeline
- **Event-Driven**: Real-Time Dashboard, Notification System
- **Layered**: Banking Application, E-Learning Platform

These examples span across various industries and use-cases to demonstrate how different application architectures can be applied to solve specific problems. Each architecture has its strengths and weaknesses, making it suitable for different scenarios based on requirements, scalability needs, and constraints.
