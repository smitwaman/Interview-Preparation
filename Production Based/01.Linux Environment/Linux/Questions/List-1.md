### System Performance

1. **Scenario:** A web server hosted on a Linux machine is running slow. Users are experiencing high latency when accessing the website. What steps would you take to troubleshoot the issue?

### File Management

2. **Scenario:** A disk partition is running out of space on a Linux server. How would you identify which directories are consuming the most disk space, and what steps would you take to free up space?

### Networking

3. **Scenario:** A Linux server is unable to connect to the internet. How would you diagnose the issue and restore internet connectivity?

### Security

4. **Scenario:** Unauthorized users have been accessing a Linux server. How would you identify the unauthorized access and secure the server to prevent future unauthorized access?

### Automation and Scripting

5. **Scenario:** You have a repetitive task that needs to be performed daily on a Linux server, such as log rotation or data backup. How would you automate this task using shell scripting?

### User Management

6. **Scenario:** A user is unable to log in to a Linux server due to a forgotten password. How would you reset the user's password without compromising security?

### Software Installation and Management

7. **Scenario:** You need to install a new software package on a Linux server that doesn't have internet access. How would you download and install the software along with its dependencies?

### System Updates and Maintenance

8. **Scenario:** A Linux server hasn't been updated for a long time, and there are pending updates. How would you safely update the system to ensure minimal downtime and maximum compatibility?

### Virtualization and Containers

9. **Scenario:** You have multiple applications running on a single Linux server, and you want to isolate them using containers for better resource management and security. How would you implement this using Docker or another containerization tool?

### High Availability and Failover

10. **Scenario:** You have a critical application running on a Linux server that requires high availability and failover support. How would you set up a high availability cluster to ensure the application remains accessible even if one server fails?

### Backup and Disaster Recovery

11. **Scenario:** You need to implement a backup and disaster recovery plan for a Linux server hosting critical data and applications. What steps would you take to create a backup strategy and test the recovery process?

### Remote Access and Monitoring

12. **Scenario:** You need to remotely access and monitor a Linux server located in a different geographical location. How would you securely set up remote access and implement monitoring to ensure the server's health and performance?
