- Steps: Open a terminal and type `sudo adduser [username]`, replacing [username] with the desired username.
- Operations: This command will prompt you to enter additional information for the new user, such as password and user details.

**2. Add User to the sudo Group:**
- Command: `sudo usermod -aG sudo [username]`
- Steps: Open a terminal and type `sudo usermod -aG sudo [username]`, replacing [username] with the username you created in step 1.
- Operations: This command adds the user to the sudo group, granting them administrative privileges.

**3. Verify Sudo Access:**
- Command: `sudo su - [username]`
- Steps: Open a terminal and type `sudo su - [username]`, replacing [username] with the username you created.
