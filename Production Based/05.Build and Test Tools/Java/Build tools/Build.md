In Java development, various tools are used for building artifacts (such as JAR files, WAR files, etc.). Some of the commonly used tools include:

1. **Apache Maven**: Maven is a widely used build automation tool primarily for Java projects. It manages project dependencies, compiles source code, runs tests, and packages the project into JAR, WAR, or other formats. Maven uses XML-based project files (pom.xml) to define project configurations and dependencies.

2. **Gradle**: Gradle is another popular build automation tool that supports multiple languages, including Java. It offers a more flexible and concise syntax compared to Maven. Gradle build scripts are written in Groovy or Kotlin, providing a powerful DSL for defining tasks, dependencies, and configurations.

3. **Apache Ant**: Ant is an older build tool for Java projects. It uses XML-based build scripts to define tasks such as compiling source code, running tests, and packaging artifacts. While not as popular as Maven or Gradle for modern Java projects, Ant is still used in some legacy systems.

4. **Jenkins**: Jenkins is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tool that automates the building, testing, and deployment of software. It supports integration with various build tools, including Maven and Gradle, to trigger builds based on code changes and schedule builds at specific intervals.

5. **Make**: Make is a general-purpose build automation tool used in various programming languages, including Java. While it's not specific to Java, Makefiles can be created to define build tasks, dependencies, and targets for compiling Java source code and creating artifacts.

These tools provide developers with different options for building Java artifacts, depending on project requirements, preferences, and team workflows.
