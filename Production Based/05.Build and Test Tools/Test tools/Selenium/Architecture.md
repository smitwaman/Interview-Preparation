The architecture of Selenium consists of several components:

1. Selenium Client Libraries: These libraries provide the APIs to interact with web browsers. They include Selenium WebDriver, Selenium Grid, and Selenium IDE.

2. WebDriver: WebDriver is the core component that communicates directly with web browsers. It controls the browser natively by using browser-specific drivers.

3. Browser Drivers: Browser-specific drivers are required to establish a connection between the Selenium WebDriver and the respective web browser. Examples include ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver (for Firefox), and EdgeDriver.

4. JSON Wire Protocol: It's a REST API that defines the interactions between the client libraries and WebDriver. It's used to send commands to the WebDriver and receive responses.

5. Browser: The web browser where the tests are executed. Selenium supports various browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Edge.

6. Selenium Grid: It enables parallel execution of tests across multiple browsers and platforms. It consists of a hub and multiple nodes where tests are executed.

Overall, Selenium's architecture enables cross-browser and cross-platform testing by providing a set of tools and protocols to interact with web browsers programmatically.
