For Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in HTML projects, the build artifact creation process is relatively simple compared to more complex programming languages like Python or Java. However, there are still some tools and techniques that can be used to automate the process and ensure consistency and reliability in the deployment pipeline. Here are some tools commonly used for building artifacts from HTML projects in CI/CD pipelines:

1. **Node.js/npm/yarn**: Node.js along with npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn (a package manager alternative to npm) can be used to manage project dependencies, build scripts, and automation tasks. Even though HTML projects are primarily static, frontend dependencies like CSS preprocessors (e.g., SASS, LESS), JavaScript libraries, and build tools (e.g., Webpack, Gulp, Grunt) can be managed using npm or yarn. These tools can be configured to automate tasks like minification, bundling, and optimizing assets.

2. **Webpack**: Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications that can also handle other assets like CSS, images, and fonts. It can be configured with loaders and plugins to transform and bundle HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for production. Webpack is commonly used in modern frontend development workflows and can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to build artifacts for deployment.

3. **Gulp**: Gulp is a task runner built on Node.js that allows you to automate repetitive tasks in your workflow. It can be used to perform tasks such as concatenation, minification, image optimization, and asset versioning. Gulp plugins are available for processing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, making it a useful tool for building artifacts from HTML projects.

4. **Grunt**: Grunt is another task runner similar to Gulp that automates repetitive tasks in your workflow. It provides a wide range of plugins for tasks like compilation, minification, linting, and testing. Grunt can be configured to build artifacts from HTML projects by processing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and optimizing assets for production.

5. **Parcel**: Parcel is a web application bundler that requires zero configuration and supports many asset types out of the box, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. It automatically analyzes project dependencies and creates optimized bundles with minimal configuration. Parcel can be a good choice for simple HTML projects that require a straightforward build process.

6. **Shell scripts**: For simpler projects, shell scripts can be used to manually execute build tasks such as minification, concatenation, and optimization of assets. While not as sophisticated as task runners or bundlers, shell scripts provide flexibility and can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate the build process.

These tools, along with CI/CD platforms like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, and GitHub Actions, enable developers to automate the build process of HTML projects, ensuring consistency and reliability in deployment pipelines. Depending on the complexity and requirements of the project, developers can choose the most suitable tool or combination of tools to build artifacts for deployment.
