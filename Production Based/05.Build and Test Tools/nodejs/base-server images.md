Sure! Here are the commonly used base and server images for each Node.js project architecture:

### 1. Simple/Basic:

- **Base Image**: `node:latest`
- **Server Image**: `node:latest`

### 2. Express.js Web App:

- **Base Image**: `node:latest`
- **Server Image**: `node:latest`

### 3. REST API:

- **Base Image**: `node:latest`
- **Server Image**: `node:latest`

### 4. MVC (Model-View-Controller):

- **Base Image**: `node:latest`
- **Server Image**: `node:latest`

### 5. Microservices:

- **Base Image**: `node:latest`
- **Server Image**: `node:latest`

### 6. GraphQL API:

- **Base Image**: `node:latest`
- **Server Image**: `node:latest`

### 7. Real-time Web App (e.g., Socket.io):

- **Base Image**: `node:latest`
- **Server Image**: `node:latest`

### Explanation:

- **Base Image (`node:latest`)**: Provides a Node.js runtime environment to execute Node.js applications.

- **Server Image (`node:latest`)**: A Node.js runtime environment to execute and serve Node.js applications.

For Docker, you can use these images directly by specifying them in your `Dockerfile` using the `FROM` directive. For example, for a REST API using Express.js:

```Dockerfile
# Use node as the base image
FROM node:latest

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy source files
COPY . .

# Run the application
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

Or for a Real-time Web App using Socket.io:

```Dockerfile
# Use node as the base image
FROM node:latest

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy source files
COPY . .

# Run the application
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

Adjust the `latest` tag or specify a version number if needed. These images are commonly used and are available on Docker Hub for easy integration with Docker.
