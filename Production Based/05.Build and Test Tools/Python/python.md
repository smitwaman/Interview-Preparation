In Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for Python projects, several artifact build tools are commonly used to automate the process of building and packaging Python applications. Some popular artifact build tools for Python in CI/CD pipelines include:

1. **setuptools**: setuptools is a library that facilitates building, packaging, and distributing Python projects. It provides utilities for specifying project metadata, dependencies, and packaging scripts. With setuptools, you can create distribution packages such as source distributions (`sdist`) and binary distributions (`bdist`).

2. **wheel**: wheel is a built-package format for Python that aims to be faster and more efficient than the traditional `sdist` format. It is commonly used for distributing pre-built binary distributions of Python packages. The `bdist_wheel` command provided by setuptools allows you to create wheel distribution packages.

3. **twine**: twine is a utility for securely uploading Python packages to the Python Package Index (PyPI) or other package indexes. It supports uploading both source distributions (`sdist`) and binary distributions (`bdist`) created by setuptools. Twine ensures that packages are securely transmitted to the package index.

4. **pip**: pip is the package installer for Python that allows users to install and manage Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or other package indexes. In CI/CD pipelines, pip is often used to install project dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file or to install locally-built packages for testing.

5. **tox**: tox is a testing tool for Python projects that automates testing in multiple environments. It allows you to define test environments and test commands in a configuration file (`tox.ini`). In CI/CD pipelines, tox can be used to run tests in different Python versions and environments to ensure compatibility and reliability.

6. **pytest**: pytest is a testing framework for Python that provides a simple and flexible way to write and execute tests. It is widely used in Python projects for writing unit tests, functional tests, and integration tests. pytest integrates well with CI/CD pipelines and can be easily configured to run tests automatically during the build process.

These artifact build tools, along with other CI/CD tools such as Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, and GitHub Actions, enable developers to automate the build, test, and deployment processes of Python applications, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery.
