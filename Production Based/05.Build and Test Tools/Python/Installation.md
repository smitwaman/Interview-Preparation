Sure! Here's a simple "Hello World" program in Python, along with instructions to set up a virtual environment, install dependencies, and run the program.

### 1. "Hello World" Python Program

Create a file named `hello.py` with the following content:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

#### a. Install `virtualenv`:

If you haven't installed `virtualenv` yet, you can install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

#### b. Create Virtual Environment:

Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment named `myenv`:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
virtualenv myenv
```

#### c. Activate Virtual Environment:

- **On Windows**:

```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

- **On macOS and Linux**:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

In your activated virtual environment, install any dependencies (none for this simple example):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Note: You can create a `requirements.txt` file with `pip freeze > requirements.txt` if you have any dependencies.)

### 4. Run the Program

Run the `hello.py` program:

```bash
python hello.py
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```

### Summary:

1. Create a simple "Hello World" Python program (`hello.py`).
2. Set up a virtual environment using `virtualenv`.
3. Activate the virtual environment.
4. Install any dependencies using `pip`.
5. Run the Python program using `python`.

By following these steps, you can compile, build, and run a simple Python application in a virtual environment. This approach isolates your project's dependencies and ensures a clean environment for development.
