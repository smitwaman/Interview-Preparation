Now, question arises that how could we write Dockerfile for our application?

To write a Dockerfile for your application, follow these general steps:

1. **Choose a Base Image**: Select a base image that provides the runtime environment for your application. You can choose from official images on Docker Hub or create your own base image if needed.


2. **Set up Environment**: Configure the environment variables, working directory, and any other environment settings required by your application.

4. **Install Dependencies**: Install any dependencies or packages required by your application. This might include libraries, frameworks, or runtime dependencies.

5. **Copy Application Files**: Copy your application code and any necessary files into the container.

6. **Expose Ports**: If your application listens on specific ports, expose them so they can be accessed from outside the container.

7. **Define Startup Command**: Specify the command or script to run when the container starts. This could be the entry point for your application or a command to start a server.

Here's a simple example of a Dockerfile for a Node.js application:

```Dockerfile
# Use a base image
FROM base_image:tag

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files to the container
COPY . /app

# Install dependencies (if needed)
# RUN command_to_install_dependencies

# Expose any ports your application listens on
# EXPOSE port_number

# Define the command to run your application
CMD ["command_to_run_your_application"]

```
