After Docker installation, several files and directories are created on your system to store configuration, logs, images, and other Docker-related data. Below is a list of some of the common files and directories created by Docker along with their default locations:

1. **Docker Daemon Configuration**:
   - Location: `/etc/docker/daemon.json`
   - Description: This JSON configuration file is used to configure the Docker daemon settings, such as storage drivers, network settings, logging options, etc.

2. **Docker Engine Binary**:
   - Location: `/usr/bin/docker` (or `/usr/local/bin/docker` on some systems)
   - Description: The Docker engine binary is the main executable for interacting with Docker. It provides the `docker` command-line interface (CLI) for managing Docker objects and components.

3. **Docker Images Directory**:
   - Location: `/var/lib/docker/images/`
   - Description: This directory contains the Docker images pulled or built on your system. Each image is stored as a collection of layers, which are stored in subdirectories within this directory.

4. **Docker Containers Directory**:
   - Location: `/var/lib/docker/containers/`
   - Description: This directory contains the metadata and filesystem snapshots for running Docker containers. Each container is stored in a separate subdirectory named after its container ID.

5. **Docker Volumes Directory**:
   - Location: `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`
   - Description: This directory stores Docker volumes created on your system. Each volume is stored as a separate directory within this directory.

6. **Docker Network Configuration**:
   - Location: `/etc/docker/network/`
   - Description: This directory contains configuration files for Docker networking, including bridge networks, overlay networks, etc.

7. **Docker Logs Directory**:
   - Location: `/var/log/`
   - Description: Docker logs are stored in the system's default log directory. Docker-related log files, including container logs, daemon logs, and other Docker component logs, can be found here.

8. **Docker Compose Configuration**:
   - Location: `/usr/local/bin/docker-compose` (or `/usr/bin/docker-compose` on some systems)
   - Description: Docker Compose binary is installed separately from Docker Engine. The default location may vary depending on your system and installation method.

9. **Docker Compose Configuration File**:
   - Location: `docker-compose.yml` (or other specified file)
   - Description: Docker Compose configuration files define multi-container Docker applications. They specify services, networks, volumes, and other settings for Docker Compose to manage.
