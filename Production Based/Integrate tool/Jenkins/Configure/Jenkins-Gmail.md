Configuring Jenkins to send email notifications through Gmail involves several steps. Here's a detailed guide:

### Step 1: Install and Configure Email Extension Plugin
1. Log in to your Jenkins dashboard.
2. Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins."
3. Go to the "Available" tab and search for "Email Extension Plugin."
4. Check the checkbox next to the plugin and click "Install without restart."
5. Once installed, restart Jenkins to apply the changes.

### Step 2: Configure Jenkins System Settings
1. Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System."
2. Scroll down to the "E-mail Notification" section.
3. Configure the following settings:
   - **SMTP server**: Set the SMTP server address for Gmail, which is `smtp.gmail.com`.
   - **SMTP Port**: Use port `465` for SSL or `587` for TLS.
   - **SMTP Username**: Enter your Gmail email address.
   - **SMTP Password**: Generate an app password from your Google account settings (for security reasons, do not use your actual Gmail password).
   - **Use SSL**: Check this option for port `465`. If using port `587`, leave it unchecked and select "Use TLS" instead.
   - **Reply-To Address**: Optionally, specify a reply-to address.
   - **Test Configuration**: Click on the "Test configuration" button to verify that Jenkins can connect to the SMTP server using the provided settings.

### Step 3: Configure Jenkins Job to Send Email Notifications
1. Open the Jenkins job for which you want to configure email notifications.
2. Click on "Configure" to edit the job settings.
3. Scroll down to the "Post-build Actions" section.
4. Click on "Add post-build action" and select "Editable Email Notification."
5. Configure the email notification settings:
   - **Project Recipient List**: Enter the email addresses of recipients who should receive notifications.
   - **Content Type**: Choose the content type for the email (e.g., HTML or plain text).
   - **Default Subject**: Enter a default subject for the email.
   - **Default Content**: Enter the default content for the email body.
   - **Attachments**: Optionally, specify any attachments to include in the email.
   - **Advanced Settings**: Configure any additional settings as needed, such as triggering conditions or triggers for sending emails.
6. Save the job configuration.

### Step 4: Enable Access for Less Secure Apps (Optional)
If you encounter issues with sending emails from Jenkins, you may need to enable access for less secure apps in your Gmail account settings. Follow these steps:
1. Go to your Google Account settings (https://myaccount.google.com/).
2. Navigate to the "Security" tab.
3. Scroll down to the "Less secure app access" section.
4. Turn on the toggle to allow less secure apps.

### Step 5: Test Email Notification
1. Trigger a build for the configured Jenkins job.
2. After the build completes, check the build status in Jenkins.
3. Verify that the email notification is sent to the configured recipients.
4. Check the email inbox of the recipients to ensure they have received the notification.

By following these steps, you should be able to configure Jenkins to send email notifications through Gmail successfully. Remember to regularly check your Gmail account settings and Jenkins configurations for any updates or changes.
