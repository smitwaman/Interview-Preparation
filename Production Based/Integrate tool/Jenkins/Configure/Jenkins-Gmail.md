Configuring Jenkins to send email notifications through Gmail with two-step verification requires generating an app password from your Google account. Here's a detailed guide:

### Step 1: Enable Two-Step Verification for Your Google Account
1. Go to your Google Account settings: https://myaccount.google.com/.
2. Navigate to the "Security" tab.
3. Scroll down to the "Signing in to Google" section.
4. Turn on "2-Step Verification."
5. Follow the prompts to set up two-step verification. This may involve entering your phone number and receiving a verification code.

### Step 2: Generate an App Password
1. While still in the "Security" tab of your Google Account settings, scroll down to the "Signing in to Google" section.
2. Under "App passwords," click on "App passwords."
3. You may need to re-enter your password to proceed.
4. In the "App passwords" section, select the app and device you want to generate the app password for. Choose "Other (Custom name)" if Jenkins is not listed.
5. Enter a name for the app password (e.g., "Jenkins") and click on "Generate."
6. Google will generate a 16-character app password for you. Make sure to copy this password as it will be needed later.

### Step 3: Install and Configure Email Extension Plugin in Jenkins
1. Log in to your Jenkins dashboard.
2. Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins."
3. Go to the "Available" tab and search for "Email Extension Plugin."
4. Check the checkbox next to the plugin and click "Install without restart."
5. Once installed, restart Jenkins to apply the changes.

### Step 4: Configure Jenkins System Settings
1. Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System."
2. Scroll down to the "E-mail Notification" section.
3. Configure the following settings:
   - **SMTP server**: Set the SMTP server address for Gmail, which is `smtp.gmail.com`.
   - **SMTP Port**: Use port `465` for SSL or `587` for TLS.
   - **SMTP Username**: Enter your Gmail email address.
   - **SMTP Password**: Paste the app password generated in Step 2.
   - **Use SSL**: Check this option for port `465`. If using port `587`, leave it unchecked and select "Use TLS" instead.
   - **Reply-To Address**: Optionally, specify a reply-to address.
   - **Test Configuration**: Click on the "Test configuration" button to verify that Jenkins can connect to the SMTP server using the provided settings.

### Step 5: Configure Jenkins Job to Send Email Notifications
1. Open the Jenkins job for which you want to configure email notifications.
2. Click on "Configure" to edit the job settings.
3. Scroll down to the "Post-build Actions" section.
4. Click on "Add post-build action" and select "Editable Email Notification."
5. Configure the email notification settings as desired, using the Gmail account email address for the recipients.
6. Save the job configuration.

### Step 6: Test Email Notification
1. Trigger a build for the configured Jenkins job.
2. After the build completes, check the build status in Jenkins.
3. Verify that the email notification is sent to the configured recipients.
4. Check the email inbox of the recipients to ensure they have received the notification.

By following these steps, you should be able to configure Jenkins to send email notifications through Gmail with two-step verification successfully. Make sure to keep your app password secure and regularly review your Google account security settings.
