Configuring Jenkins to work with Nexus Artifact Manager involves several steps. Nexus Repository Manager is a repository manager used to store and manage binary artifacts.

### Step 1: Install Nexus Artifact Manager
1. Download and install Nexus Repository Manager from the official website: [Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus/repository-oss)
2. Follow the installation instructions provided in the Nexus Repository Manager documentation.

### Step 2: Configure Nexus Repository Manager
1. Access the Nexus Repository Manager web interface.
2. Log in with the default credentials (admin/admin123) or the credentials you set during installation.
3. Set up repositories to store your artifacts. You can create repositories for Maven, npm, Docker, etc., depending on your requirements.
4. Configure security settings, users, and roles as per your organization's policies.

### Step 3: Install Nexus Artifact Uploader Plugin in Jenkins
1. Log in to your Jenkins dashboard.
2. Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins."
3. Go to the "Available" tab and search for "Nexus Artifact Uploader."
4. Check the checkbox next to the plugin and click "Install without restart."
5. Once installed, restart Jenkins to apply the changes.

### Step 4: Configure Nexus Artifact Manager in Jenkins
1. Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System."
2. Scroll down to the "Nexus Artifact Uploader" section.
3. Enter the following details:
   - **Nexus URL**: Enter the URL of your Nexus Repository Manager instance.
   - **Repository**: Enter the name of the repository where you want to upload artifacts.
   - **Credentials**: Click on "Add" and select the credentials for authenticating with Nexus Repository Manager.
4. Click on "Test Connection" to verify that Jenkins can connect to Nexus Repository Manager using the provided credentials.
5. Save the configuration.

### Step 5: Configure Jenkins Job to Upload Artifacts to Nexus
1. Create or open the Jenkins job that produces artifacts (e.g., builds a Maven project).
2. Scroll down to the "Post-build Actions" section.
3. Click on "Add post-build action" and select "Archive the artifacts."
4. Specify the files or directories that you want to archive as artifacts.
5. Click on "Add post-build action" again and select "Deploy artifacts to Nexus Repository Manager."
6. Configure the following settings:
   - **Artifacts to deploy**: Enter the file patterns or directories containing artifacts to deploy.
   - **Target repository**: Select the Nexus repository where artifacts should be deployed.
   - **Artifact type**: Select the type of artifact being deployed (e.g., Maven, npm, Docker).
   - **Version**: Specify the version of the artifacts being deployed.
   - **Credentials**: Select the credentials for authenticating with Nexus Repository Manager.
7. Save the job configuration.

### Step 6: Test Artifact Deployment
1. Trigger a build for the configured Jenkins job.
2. Wait for the build to complete.
3. Check the Nexus Repository Manager web interface to verify that artifacts have been uploaded to the specified repository.

### Step 7: Additional Considerations
- Ensure that Jenkins server has network access to the Nexus Repository Manager instance.
- Securely manage Nexus credentials in Jenkins.
- Regularly monitor artifact uploads to Nexus to ensure successful deployments.
- Configure retention policies and cleanup tasks in Nexus Repository Manager to manage artifact storage.

By following these steps, you should be able to configure Jenkins to upload artifacts to Nexus Repository Manager automatically as part of your CI/CD pipeline. This helps in managing and versioning your binary artifacts efficiently.
