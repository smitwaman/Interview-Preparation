**Module 1: Getting Started with Bash Scripting**

**Introduction to Bash scripting:**
Bash scripting is the process of creating scripts or programs using the Bash shell, a command-line interpreter for Unix-like operating systems. Bash scripting allows users to automate repetitive tasks, perform system administration tasks, and create simple programs by writing a series of commands in a text file.

**Setting up a development environment:**
To get started with Bash scripting, you'll need a text editor to write your scripts and access to a Bash shell to execute them. Most Unix-like operating systems come with Bash pre-installed. You can use a terminal emulator like Terminal on macOS or Linux, or PuTTY on Windows, to access the Bash shell. Additionally, you can use any text editor such as Vim, Emacs, Nano, or Visual Studio Code to write your Bash scripts.

**Writing your first Bash script:**
Let's create a simple Bash script that prints "Hello, world!" to the terminal.

1. Open your text editor and create a new file named `hello.sh`.
2. Add the following line to the file:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Hello, world!"
   ```
   This line (`#!/bin/bash`) is called a shebang and indicates the path to the Bash interpreter.
3. Save the file.

**Executing a Bash script:**
After creating the script, you need to make it executable and then run it.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved `hello.sh`.
3. Make the script executable by running the following command:
   ```bash
   chmod +x hello.sh
   ```
   This command changes the permissions of the file to make it executable.
4. Run the script by typing:
   ```bash
   ./hello.sh
   ```
   You should see the output:
   ```
   Hello, world!
   ```

Congratulations! You've just written and executed your first Bash script. From here, you can start exploring more advanced Bash scripting concepts and creating more complex scripts to automate tasks or solve problems.
