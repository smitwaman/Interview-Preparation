**Text Processing**

**Basic text manipulation tools (grep, sed, awk):**
In Bash scripting, several command-line tools are available for text manipulation, including `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`.

1. **grep:** Used for searching text patterns within files or standard input.
   
   Example:
   ```bash
   grep "pattern" file.txt
   ```

2. **sed:** Stream editor used for performing basic text transformations.
   
   Example:
   ```bash
   sed 's/old_text/new_text/g' file.txt
   ```

3. **awk:** A versatile tool for text processing, it can manipulate text data based on field separators.
   
   Example:
   ```bash
   awk '{print $1}' file.txt
   ```

**String operations in Bash:**
Bash provides several string manipulation operations, including concatenation, substring extraction, length calculation, and pattern matching.

Example:
```bash
# Concatenation
first_name="John"
last_name="Doe"
full_name="$first_name $last_name"

# Substring extraction
substring="${full_name:0:4}"

# Length calculation
length=${#full_name}

# Pattern matching
if [[ $full_name == *"John"* ]]; then
    echo "John found in full name"
fi
```

**Regular expressions in Bash:**
Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. Bash supports regex through various commands like `grep`, `sed`, and within conditional expressions.

Example:
```bash
# Using grep with regular expressions
grep "^start" file.txt

# Using sed with regular expressions
sed 's/[0-9]/X/g' file.txt

# Using regular expressions in a conditional expression
if [[ "$variable" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    echo "Variable contains only digits"
fi
```

Understanding text processing techniques and tools in Bash is crucial for efficiently manipulating text data, extracting relevant information, and automating various tasks involving textual input.
