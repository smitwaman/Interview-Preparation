**Advanced Topics**

**Working with arrays:**
Arrays in Bash scripting allow storing multiple values under a single variable name. They are useful for storing and manipulating collections of data.

Example of working with arrays:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Declare an array
my_array=(apple banana cherry)

# Access elements of the array
echo "${my_array[0]}"  # Output: apple

# Iterate over the array
for fruit in "${my_array[@]}"; do
    echo "$fruit"
done
```

**Advanced scripting techniques (subshells, command substitution):**
Subshells and command substitution are advanced scripting techniques used to execute commands within a script and capture their output.

Example of subshells and command substitution:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Subshell example
echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"

# Command substitution example
files_count=$(ls | wc -l)
echo "Number of files in the directory: $files_count"
```
