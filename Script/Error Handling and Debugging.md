**Error Handling and Debugging**

**Handling errors and exceptions:**
In Bash scripting, error handling involves detecting and responding to errors and exceptions that may occur during script execution. This can be achieved using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to check for error conditions and appropriate error handling mechanisms such as `exit` or `return`.

Example of handling errors:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to divide two numbers
function divide() {
    if [ $2 -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Error: Division by zero!"
        exit 1
    fi
    result=$(( $1 / $2 ))
    echo "Result: $result"
}

# Call the function with error handling
divide 10 0
```

**Debugging techniques and best practices:**
Debugging Bash scripts involves identifying and fixing errors in the code to ensure correct behavior. Common debugging techniques include printing debug messages using `echo` statements, using the `-x` option with the `bash` command to enable debugging mode, and using tools like `set -e` to exit immediately if any command returns a non-zero exit status.

Example of enabling debugging mode:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -x

# Script logic
echo "Hello, world!"
```

**Logging and troubleshooting:**
Logging in Bash scripting involves capturing and recording relevant information during script execution for troubleshooting and analysis purposes. This can be achieved by redirecting output to log files using the `>` or `>>` operators or using logging libraries like `logger`.

Example of logging to a file:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Redirect output to log file
echo "Script started" >> script.log

# Script logic
echo "Hello, world!"

# Log completion
echo "Script completed" >> script.log
```

Additionally, troubleshooting Bash scripts involves identifying and resolving issues by analyzing error messages, reviewing code logic, and testing scripts in controlled environments.

By implementing proper error handling, debugging techniques, logging, and troubleshooting practices, Bash scriptwriters can improve the reliability, maintainability, and performance of their scripts, leading to more robust and efficient automation solutions.
