JavaScript package managers mentioned earlier on Linux:

1. **npm (Node Package Manager)**:
   - npm usually comes bundled with Node.js. To install Node.js and npm using a package manager like `apt` on Debian-based Linux distributions, you can use the following commands:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install nodejs npm
     ```

2. **Yarn**:
   - Yarn can be installed via npm. Once npm is installed, you can install Yarn globally using the following npm command:
     ```
     sudo npm install -g yarn
     ```

3. **pnpm**:
   - pnpm can also be installed via npm. Once npm is installed, you can install pnpm globally using the following npm command:
     ```
     sudo npm install -g pnpm
     ```

4. **Bower**:
   - Bower can be installed via npm. Once npm is installed, you can install Bower globally using the following npm command:
     ```
     sudo npm install -g bower
     ```

These commands will install the respective package managers globally on your Linux system, allowing you to use them from the command line to manage dependencies and packages in your JavaScript projects
